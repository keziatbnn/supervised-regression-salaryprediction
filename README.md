# Supervised Regression Salary Prediction
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience using supervised regression models. The dataset used contains features such as years of experience and corresponding salary values. 

Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for accurate salary prediction. We use regression linear, decision tree, and random forest model in this case.

### Goals
1. **Accurate Salary Prediction**: Build a model that can predict salaries with high precision.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Analyze and compare the performance odf regression algorithms.
3. **Generalization**: Ensure the model performs well on unseen data to avoid overfitting.

### Insights
- The relationship between years of experience and salary can provide useful trends for decision-making in hiring or budgeting.
- Evaluating multiple regression models helps understand their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios.
- Understanding the causes of overfitting and underfitting improves the reliability of predictions for real-world applications.

### Advices
- For salaries in different industries or regions, consider applying a weighted factor based on the economic standards of that region.
- Discounted predictions for internships or entry-level roles may attract more accurate results when combining years of experience with additional variables like education or certifications.
- Salary ranges should be adjusted based on employment type (e.g., full-time, part-time, freelance) to enhance prediction relevance.
- Consider adding a salary band threshold that identifies potential outliers for further evaluation and adjustment.
